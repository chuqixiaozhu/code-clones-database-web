# code-clones-database-web
The goal of this project is to specify and implement a Code Clones Database System. The system should manage and organize a database of classified clones. It should also be deployed as a web-app where a user can explore the database and see the actual source code of the clone pairs. 
This project is based on work at ASEâ€™16:
