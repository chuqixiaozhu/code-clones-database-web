# code-clones-database-web
Code Clones are pieces of source code that are similar. These pieces can be defined as clones if they are textually, structurally or functionally similar. Several code clone detection techniques have been proposed and evaluated, however there is still the need of an open, crowd-sourced, manually curated database of code clones to support evaluation and comparison of such tools. The goal of this project is to specify and implement a Code Clones Database System. The system should manage and organize a database of classified clones. It should also be deployed as a web-app where a user can explore the database and see the actual source code of the clone pairs. 

This project is based on work at ASEâ€™16:
